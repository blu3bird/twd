* Register
  Timestamps are always sent.
  Registration involves sending a challenge, along with the parameters
  of the test and characteristics of the client, and desired communication
  port number, response involves selecting a new port number, characteristics
  of the server and sending the accepted parameters of the test, and a cookie.
* Initialization and nat hole punching
  client attempts to rendezvous on that port + cookie, server sends acceptance 
  from that port to the visible port from the client. Client indicates
  it got acceptance and proposes a start time for the test based on a
  sane delta of the rtt*3 and the relevant timestamps. Server accepts start
  time, and both clients attempt to start at the same time.
* Start Test
  test proceeds for the duration negotiated.
* End Test
  although we will try to keep this minimal, summary data is sent at the
  concusion of the test, and if large, this could get messy.
* End connection
